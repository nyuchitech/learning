    description: "Complete digital literacy standards, curricula, and assessment rubrics freely available. No licensing fees for standards progression (K-12, teachers, adults). Schools can copy, adapt, and share this entire framework.",
    example: "Download K-12 progression standards, customize for your school's context (e.g., adding local language requirements), and share your adapted version with neighboring schools."

  {
    number: "02",
    title: "Evidence-Based",
    description: "Standards aligned with 2050 job market requirements (digital fluency, AI collaboration, remote work competencies). Progression based on cognitive development research. Citizenship-first approach proven to improve online safety outcomes.",
    example: "Framework prioritizes digital citizenship before tool mastery because research shows ethical foundation matters more than technical skills for long-term success."
  },
  {
    number: "03",
    title: "Competency-Focused",
    description: "Standards emphasize what learners can DO, not just what they know. Portfolio-based assessment demonstrates actual digital competencies. Badges and microcredentials document skills employers recognize.",
    example: "Instead of \"knows how to use spreadsheets,\" standard is \"can analyze real-world data using spreadsheets and create data-driven recommendations\"—demonstrable competency, not abstract knowledge."

  },
  {
    number: "05",
    title: "Culturally Responsive",
    description: "Multilingual standards (English, French, African languages). Examples and case studies reflect African contexts, not Western assumptions. Respects diverse cultural values around privacy, community, and digital participation.",

  },
  {
    number: "06",
    title: "Cost-Conscious",
    description: "Open-source learning tools (Khan Academy, Scratch, GCFGlobal) instead of expensive proprietary platforms. Free assessment rubrics and badging systems. Professional development designed for in-house delivery, not expensive consultants.",
    example: "Framework recommends free/freemium tools (Google Workspace for Education, Canva Free, Scratch) that deliver full digital literacy curriculum at zero software licensing cost."
