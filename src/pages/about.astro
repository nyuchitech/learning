          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            To empower developing countries to <strong>leapfrog traditional educational models</strong> by providing
            open, evidence-based frameworks for digital transformation that prioritize <strong>competencies over credentials</strong> and
            <strong>learning outcomes over technology deployment</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="mission-detail">
            We believe that Africa and the developing world—unburdened by legacy educational infrastructure and institutional inertia—have
            a unique opportunity to build digital-first learning environments optimized for the 2050 workplace from day one.

          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            By 2035, Nyuchi Learning frameworks will be implemented in schools across <strong>Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific</strong>,
            enabling <strong>10 million students</strong> to develop the competencies—<em>grit, adaptability, collaboration, critical thinking</em>—that
            predict success in an uncertain future.
          </p>
          <p class="vision-detail">
            We envision a world where developing countries lead educational innovation, creating models wealthy nations will study and replicate.

        <div class="leapfrog-text">
          <p class="lead">
            <strong>Traditional educational models are failing spectacularly.</strong> Research shows that 87% of global executives report
            critical skills gaps, yet schools worldwide continue optimizing for standardized tests that predict only 4% of job performance.
            The global skills mismatch costs $8.5 trillion annually.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>But here's the opportunity:</strong> Developing countries aren't burdened by the institutional inertia, legacy infrastructure,
            and political paralysis plaguing educational systems in wealthy nations. You can build from first principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            History shows developing regions often leapfrog developed ones when unconstrained by legacy systems—mobile payments in Kenya
            transformed global finance by bypassing credit card infrastructure. Education offers the same opportunity.

          <p>
            Nyuchi's inception began with founder Bryan Fawcett's early fascination with computers—a childhood
            hobby that evolved into a lifelong pursuit of technological innovation aimed at transforming lives and empowering communities.

          <h3><GraduationCap class="journey-icon" size={24} strokeWidth={2} /> The Awakening: Teaching in South Africa</h3>
          <p>
            While teaching in South Africa, Bryan encountered pressing demand among educators and schools
            for digital solutions. This gap revealed a profound truth:
            <strong>Africa didn't need more technology—it needed accessible, practical solutions designed for
            African realities.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            But more than that, Africa didn't need to copy failing Western models. It had the opportunity to
            <strong>leapfrog them entirely</strong>—building educational systems optimized for the future from day one.

        </div>

        <div class="journey-step">
          <h3><MapPin class="journey-icon" size={24} strokeWidth={2} /> The Journey: Built on Dusty African Roads</h3>
          <p>
            Soon after Nyuchi's conception, Bryan traveled along the dusty roads of Africa for several years.
            Cloud resources and online collaboration tools became second nature—the lifeblood
            of the company. This experience fundamentally shaped Nyuchi's DNA:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Remote-first by necessity:</strong> Built to work from anywhere, with anything</li>
            <li><strong>African reality-tested:</strong> Optimized for intermittent connectivity and limited bandwidth</li>
            <li><strong>Practical innovation:</strong> Solutions that work in real conditions, not just theory</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-first naturally:</strong> Because that's how Africa works</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="emphasis">
            On these dusty roads, the Nyuchi we know now grew—fueled by passion and a commitment to make education
            as accessible and effective as possible through solutions built for Africa and the developing world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="journey-step">
          <h3>The Commitment: Zimbabwe First, World-Focused</h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, Nyuchi Africa (PVT) Ltd. was formally registered in Zimbabwe. This wasn't just a business decision—it
            was a declaration of commitment to local economy reinvestment and African development.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="founder-quote">
            "We want to grow it and support our local economy. Money earned internationally is funneled back
            into Zimbabwe to build and grow and support there."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            But we also recognized that challenges facing Zimbabwe—limited resources, infrastructure gaps, mobile-first
            populations—are challenges facing developing countries globally. Solutions that work in Zimbabwe work in Jakarta,
            Lagos, Lima, and Suva.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Zimbabwe-registered. Pan-African priority. Globally focused.</strong> This is the Ubuntu principle in action:
            when we help schools across the developing world succeed, we all grow stronger.

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <div class="differentiators-grid">
        <div class="differentiator">
          <h3>Research-Driven, Not Technology-Driven</h3>
          <p>
            We start with evidence on what predicts success (grit, adaptability, collaboration), then select
            technologies that develop these competencies. Most EdTech does the opposite.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h3>Competencies Over Credentials</h3>
          <p>
            GPA predicts only 4% of job performance. We focus on the 96% that matters—character strengths,
            problem-solving, learning agility, collaboration.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h3>Open & Shareable, Not Proprietary</h3>
          <p>
            Our frameworks are freely available. Copy them, adapt them, improve them, share them. When one school
            succeeds, we all benefit. This is Ubuntu.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h3>Implementation-Focused, Not Just Theoretical</h3>
          <p>
            We provide detailed roadmaps, budget templates, technology specifications, and success metrics—not
            abstract principles. Schools know exactly what to do and how much it costs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h3>Mobile-First, Not Desktop-Adapted</h3>
          <p>
            We design full learning experiences for smartphones from day one. This isn't compromise—it's recognizing
            how billions of students actually access technology.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h3>Affordable Excellence, Not Expensive Mediocrity</h3>
          <p>
            60-80% cost reduction through open-source solutions while delivering superior outcomes. Not cheaper
            and worse—cheaper and better.
