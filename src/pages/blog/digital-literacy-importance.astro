        In an era of rapid technological change, teaching students to use today's tools isn't enough.
        True digital literacy means developing critical thinking skills that will serve students
        regardless of how technology evolves.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">The Problem with Tool-Focused Education</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Many schools approach technology education by teaching specific tools: how to use Microsoft
        Word, how to create a PowerPoint presentation, how to navigate a particular website. While
        these skills have immediate practical value, they become obsolete as technology changes.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Consider: Students who learned to type on typewriters in the 1980s had to relearn for
        computers. Those who mastered MySpace in the 2000s found their knowledge irrelevant when
        Facebook emerged. The students we're teaching today will graduate into a job market using
        tools that don't yet exist.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">What is True Digital Literacy?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Digital literacy is the ability to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information using
        digital technologies. It goes far beyond knowing which buttons to click.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">Core Components of Digital Literacy:</h3>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-6 mb-2">1. Critical Thinking & Evaluation</h4>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Assessing the credibility of online sources</li>
        <li>Identifying misinformation and bias</li>
        <li>Understanding algorithms and how they shape what we see</li>
        <li>Recognizing when AI-generated content may be unreliable</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-6 mb-2">2. Digital Citizenship</h4>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Understanding online privacy and data rights</li>
        <li>Practicing respectful communication in digital spaces</li>
        <li>Recognizing and preventing cyberbullying</li>
        <li>Understanding digital footprints and their long-term implications</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-6 mb-2">3. Computational Thinking</h4>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Breaking complex problems into manageable parts</li>
        <li>Recognizing patterns and creating algorithms</li>
        <li>Understanding how systems work, not just how to use them</li>
        <li>Debugging—identifying and solving problems systematically</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-6 mb-2">4. Creative Expression</h4>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Using technology to create, not just consume</li>
        <li>Telling stories through multiple media (text, video, audio, graphics)</li>
        <li>Remixing and building on others' work appropriately</li>
        <li>Understanding intellectual property and fair use</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-6 mb-2">5. Collaboration & Communication</h4>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Working effectively in distributed teams</li>
        <li>Using digital tools for project management</li>
        <li>Communicating across cultural and linguistic boundaries</li>
        <li>Providing and receiving feedback constructively</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Digital Literacy Across Grade Levels</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Our framework provides a K-12 progression that builds these competencies systematically:
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">K-2: Foundation</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        At the earliest levels, students learn the basics of online safety, password hygiene, and
        respectful communication. They begin to understand that not everything they see online is
        true and that they should ask trusted adults for help.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">3-5: Tool Mastery</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Elementary students learn productivity tools, but more importantly, they learn research
        skills: how to find information, how to evaluate if a website is trustworthy, what plagiarism
        is and why it matters. They begin creating original digital content and understanding that
        the internet is something they can contribute to, not just consume from.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">6-8: Critical Competency</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Middle school students dive deeper into coding (Python or JavaScript), data literacy, and
        cybersecurity. They learn about their digital footprint and how to manage their online
        reputation. They study social media literacy—understanding how platforms work, how to
        recognize manipulation, and how to be a positive digital citizen.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">9-12: Career Readiness</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        High school students develop advanced technical skills aligned with career interests:
        web development, data science, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. But they also study
        AI ethics, digital equity issues, and the societal implications of technology. They learn
        to collaborate with AI tools, understanding both their power and limitations.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Why This Matters for Africa</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Africa has a unique opportunity to leapfrog traditional technology adoption curves. Just as
        many African countries went straight to mobile phones without building extensive landline
        infrastructure, African students can develop sophisticated digital literacy without being
        burdened by outdated approaches.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">The 2050 Job Market</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        By 2050, the job market will be fundamentally different:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Many current jobs will be automated</li>
        <li>New jobs will emerge that we can't yet imagine</li>
        <li>Remote and distributed work will be standard</li>
        <li>AI collaboration will be a baseline skill</li>
        <li>Continuous learning will be essential</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Students with strong digital literacy won't just be able to use the tools of 2050—they'll
        be able to learn them quickly, evaluate them critically, and use them creatively to solve
        problems.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Beyond Individual Skills: Systemic Change</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Digital literacy isn't just about individual students—it requires systemic change:
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">Teacher Professional Development</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Teachers need ongoing training not just in tools, but in pedagogical approaches for teaching
        digital literacy. Our framework includes tiered professional development:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Universal staff competencies (privacy, basic platforms)</li>
        <li>Teaching-specific skills (pedagogical technology integration)</li>
        <li>Leadership skills (data analytics, AI evaluation)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">Parent and Community Engagement</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Digital literacy education works best when reinforced at home. The framework includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Just-in-time learning for parents (short video tutorials)</li>
        <li>Multilingual support</li>
        <li>Digital Family Nights (hands-on learning)</li>
        <li>Resources in multiple languages</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">Cross-Curricular Integration</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Digital literacy shouldn't be confined to computer class. It should be integrated across
        the curriculum:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>English:</strong> Digital storytelling, evaluating online sources</li>
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> Data visualization, statistical analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong> Data collection tools, simulation software</li>
        <li><strong>Social Studies:</strong> Digital activism, misinformation analysis, digital equity</li>
        <li><strong>Arts:</strong> Digital media creation, design principles</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Measuring Digital Literacy</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        How do we know if students are developing digital literacy? Our framework includes
        assessments that go beyond "can you use this tool?":
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Can students identify credible vs. non-credible sources?</li>
        <li>Can they explain how an algorithm might create bias?</li>
        <li>Can they create original digital content?</li>
        <li>Can they collaborate effectively in digital spaces?</li>
        <li>Can they protect their privacy and security online?</li>
        <li>Can they learn new tools independently?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">The Path Forward</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Developing comprehensive digital literacy across a school requires:
      </p>
      <ol class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3 list-decimal">
        <li><strong>Leadership commitment:</strong> Digital literacy as a core priority, not an add-on</li>
        <li><strong>Curriculum integration:</strong> Woven throughout subjects, not isolated</li>
        <li><strong>Teacher support:</strong> Ongoing professional development and resources</li>
        <li><strong>Community engagement:</strong> Parents as partners in digital learning</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous evolution:</strong> Regular updates as technology and society change</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The students we're educating today will graduate into a world we can barely imagine. We
        can't predict which tools they'll use or which specific technical skills will be most
        valuable. But we can ensure they have the critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability
        to thrive in whatever digital future emerges.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        That's the promise of true digital literacy—not just preparing students for today's
        technology, but empowering them to shape tomorrow's.
