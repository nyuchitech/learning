        Today marks an important milestone in our mission to transform K-12 education across Africa.
        We're excited to introduce a comprehensive digital framework designed to help schools leverage
        technology to prepare students for the rapidly evolving job market of 2050.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">The Vision</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Our framework transforms traditional K-12 schools into digitally-enabled learning ecosystems
        that serve students, staff, and parents/guardians. Built on cloud and open-source infrastructure,
        it prioritizes universal digital access, digital literacy, mobile-first experiences, and
        AI-driven insights—all designed for cost-efficiency and scalability.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Why Now?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The statistics speak for themselves: internet penetration in Africa has grown from 37.4% in
        2014 to 67.5% in 2024. This explosive digital transformation presents both opportunities and
        challenges for educational institutions.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        By 2050, the job market will demand skills that many current educational systems aren't
        adequately preparing students for:
      </p>

      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Digital fluency as baseline competency</li>
        <li>Ability to work across cloud platforms and distributed teams</li>
        <li>AI collaboration and prompt engineering skills</li>
        <li>Data literacy and interpretation</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity awareness</li>
        <li>Adaptive learning in rapidly evolving tech landscapes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Core Principles</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Our framework is built on six foundational principles:</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">1. Universal Access</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Digital tools must be available to all students, regardless of socioeconomic status. This
        includes device lending programs, mobile hotspot distribution, and offline-capable applications.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">2. Digital Literacy First</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Technology enablement must be paired with critical thinking and digital citizenship. We don't
        just teach students to use tools—we teach them to think critically about technology and its
        role in society.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">3. Mobile-Centric Design</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Recognizing that smartphones are the primary access devices for most users in Africa, all
        systems are designed with a mobile-first approach using Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">4. Cost Efficiency</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Open-source and cloud solutions maximize limited school budgets. Our framework can reduce
        infrastructure costs by 60-80% compared to commercial alternatives while maintaining
        world-class functionality.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">5. Data-Driven Decisions</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Analytics and AI-powered insights inform instruction, support services, and strategic
        planning. Early warning systems can identify at-risk students before they fail, while
        personalized learning pathways help each student reach their potential.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">6. Community-Centered</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Creating seamless experiences across students, staff, and parents/guardians ensures the
        entire community is engaged in the educational process.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Implementation Timeline</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The framework follows a practical 3-year implementation roadmap with a total investment of
        approximately $181,000:
      </p>

      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Year 1 ($78K):</strong> Foundation - Infrastructure setup, device rollout, and initial training</li>
        <li><strong>Year 2 ($59K):</strong> Integration & Insight - AI deployment and platform maturity</li>
        <li><strong>Year 3 ($44K):</strong> Optimization & Sustainability - Advanced analytics and sustainable operations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">What Makes This Different</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Unlike many technology initiatives that focus solely on hardware or software, our framework
        takes a holistic approach that addresses:
      </p>

      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Infrastructure and connectivity challenges</li>
        <li>Digital literacy at all levels (K-12 progression)</li>
        <li>Professional development for educators</li>
        <li>Parent and community engagement</li>
        <li>Data governance and privacy</li>
        <li>Equity and accessibility</li>
        <li>Long-term sustainability</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Join the Journey</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This framework represents a starting point, not a final destination. We invite educators,
        administrators, policymakers, and technology partners to explore the framework, provide
        feedback, and join us in creating a digitally-enabled future for African education.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Together, we can ensure that students across Africa don't just adapt to the digital future—they
        help shape it.
