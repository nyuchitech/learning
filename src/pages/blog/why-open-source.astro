        When budgets are tight and needs are great, every dollar counts. Open-source software
        offers a powerful solution that can save schools 60-80% on infrastructure costs while
        providing world-class educational technology.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">The Cost Challenge</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Many schools across Africa face significant budget constraints. Commercial educational
        software can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, putting advanced technology
        out of reach for schools that need it most.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Our framework demonstrates that a comprehensive 3-year digital transformation can be
        achieved for approximately $181,000—a fraction of what commercial alternatives would cost.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">What is Open-Source?</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and
        enhance. Unlike proprietary software where you must pay for licenses and are locked into
        a vendor's ecosystem, open-source software is typically free to use and can be customized
        to meet specific needs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Key Open-Source Tools in Our Framework</h2>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Beyond Cost Savings</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        While cost savings are significant, open-source offers additional benefits:
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">1. No Vendor Lock-In</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        With proprietary software, you're dependent on a single vendor's pricing, features, and
        roadmap. If they raise prices or discontinue a feature, you have limited options.
        Open-source software gives you freedom and control.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">2. Customization</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Open-source software can be modified to meet specific needs. Need a feature that doesn't
        exist? You can build it or hire someone to build it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">3. Privacy & Data Sovereignty</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        With self-hosted open-source solutions, student data stays under your control. You're not
        sending sensitive information to third-party servers in other countries.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">4. Learning Opportunities</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Students can learn from real-world software. Advanced students can contribute to
        open-source projects, building skills and portfolios that help with college and career
        opportunities.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">5. Community Support</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Major open-source projects have vibrant communities. When you have questions, there are
        forums, documentation, and thousands of users who can help.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Addressing Concerns</h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">"Is open-source less reliable?"</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        No. Many of the world's most critical systems run on open-source software. Major tech
        companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon rely heavily on open-source. The transparency
        of open-source often leads to more reliable software because bugs are found and fixed
        quickly by the community.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">"Do we need technical expertise?"</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Some technical knowledge is helpful, but many open-source tools now offer user-friendly
        interfaces and managed hosting options. Additionally, investing in training your IT staff
        builds long-term capacity rather than creating ongoing vendor dependency.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--text)] mt-8 mb-3">"What about support?"</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Most major open-source projects offer both community support (free) and commercial support
        contracts (paid, but typically much cheaper than proprietary alternatives). You choose the
        level of support you need.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Real-World Impact</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        By choosing open-source solutions, our framework saves approximately $20-30K over 3 years
        compared to commercial alternatives. That money can be redirected to:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>More devices for students</li>
        <li>Better internet connectivity</li>
        <li>Professional development for teachers</li>
        <li>Support staff and tutoring programs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Getting Started</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The framework provides specific guidance on implementing each open-source component,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3">
        <li>Installation and configuration instructions</li>
        <li>Integration with other systems</li>
        <li>Training resources</li>
        <li>Best practices and security considerations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[clamp(1.5rem,4vw,2rem)] font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-12 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Open-source software isn't just a budget-friendly alternative—it's often the superior
        choice for educational institutions. It provides flexibility, control, privacy, and
        learning opportunities that proprietary software cannot match.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        For African schools looking to maximize their digital transformation impact with limited
        resources, open-source is not just an option—it's essential.
