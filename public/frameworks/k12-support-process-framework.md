## Routing Criteria & Decision Trees

### Initial Classification Matrix

| Issue Category | Keywords/Indicators | Route To | Priority |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| Authentication & Access | login, password, forgot password, locked out | EdTech | Medium |

#### Teacher During Class
Teacher blocked during school hours → Escalate to High

#### Testing Deadlines
Assessment issue with <2 days until test → Escalate to High

#### SLA Risk
Ticket age >150% of SLA time → Auto-escalate priority

## Appendix A: Sample Ticket Workflows

### Workflow 1: Password Reset (Low Priority)

1. User clicks "Forgot Password" → AI chatbot
2. AI verifies identity → Sends reset link
3. If successful → Ticket closed automatically
4. If failed → Routes to EdTech Tier 1

6. Ticket closed with satisfaction survey

**Typical Time:** 2-5 minutes (AI), 15 minutes (EdTech)

### Workflow 2: Network Outage (Critical Priority)

1. Multiple users report network issues → AI detects pattern
2. AI auto-escalates to IT Ops Tier 2 (Critical)
3. IT Ops receives alert within 30 seconds
4. On-call engineer investigates immediately
5. Root cause identified → Fix applied
6. IT Ops updates all affected tickets
7. Post-incident review scheduled

**Typical Time:** 30 minutes response, 2-4 hours resolution

### Workflow 3: Feature Request (Medium Priority)

1. Teacher asks "Can we get feature X?" → AI chatbot
2. AI recognizes feature request → Routes to EdTech
3. EdTech logs feature in product roadmap
4. Product team reviews quarterly
5. If approved → Development timeline shared
6. If declined → Alternative solution suggested

**Typical Time:** 4 hours response, varies for implementation
